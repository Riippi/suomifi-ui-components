Developing and maintaining an open source project is a big effort.

There are two ways you can help:

1.  Help develop and maintain the project:

- Answer questions in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vrk-kpa/suomifi-ui-components/issues).
- Review [pull requests](https://github.com/vrk-kpa/suomifi-ui-components/pulls).
- Fix bugs and propose new features.
- Write articles and talk about accessibility on conferences and meetups.

2.  Contact [the organization](https://designsystem.suomi.fi/fi/info/) behind the design.
