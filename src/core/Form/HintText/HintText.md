HintText is a component that generates an accessible hint text for an adjacent element. Give the ID of the HintText as an `aria-describedby` value to the related component. Applicable form components in the library already have HintText as an integral part.

```js
import { HintText } from 'suomifi-ui-components';
import React from 'react';

<HintText>This is a hint regarding an adjacent input</HintText>;
```
